## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is a source coding content tracker
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is where you edit and make codes GitHub is where you store your project to share them around
3. Why do we create a branch? multiple dev can work on the same project 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? a pull request makes changes to the main code
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. cd ..
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? git fetch- gets the recent changes without merging them git pull- fetch and merge code changes from the remote repository to the local repository git merge- takes independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch
7. What is a merge conflict? an event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits
